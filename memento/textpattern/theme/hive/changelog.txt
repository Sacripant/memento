VERSION HISTORY

1.2.3: 24/06/2011

1. The !important class on textareas to override inline styling on glz_custom_field
   elements was stopping users from manually resizing any of their textareas within the

1. Change to more standard version labelling and use Textgarden.org download link.

   dropdown menus on touchscreen devices nicely, and top navigation buttons are now
   links again like they were in v1.1.

3. Tidy up of code in 'hive.php' to make editing/customising easier.

4. Added styling for the tru_tags plugin in 'custom.css', thanks to Stuart Butcher.

   save some screen estate, thanks to Stuart Butcher.
